===============================
Update 5-10-2014 - Version 1.52
===============================

- Added new option --edid. This option creates an EDID binary file (edid.bin)
  based on the calculated modeline and the monitor ranges used in its
  calculation. This file can be passed to the Linux kernel on boot in order to
  enable the same user defined timings for KMS and Xorg.


==============================
Update 5-7-2014 - Version 1.51
==============================

- Fixed segmentation fault when using some presets (lcd, k7000).
- New monitor presets:
  * pc_31_120: a preset for 120Hz capable PC CRT monitors, at 31kHz (VGA).
  * pc_70_120: same as pc_31_120, but for monitors capable of up to 70kH (SXGA).
  * r666b: Rodotron 666B-29

Note: both 32 and 64 bit binaries are provided as 'switchres32' and 'switchres64'
Remind renaming the one you need as 'switchres' if you use it with Groovy Arcade.

===============================
Update 12-14-2012 - Version 1.5
===============================

SwitchRes has been updated to make it compatible with the new crt_specs format, and to add
all the monitor presets that GroovyMAME's currently supports. This includes VESA GTF.

However this is a patch, as internally the specs are converted to the old format.
Eventually all the modeline generation engine should be updated to the new GroovyMAME's methods.

==================================================

See output of "switchres -h" for best information on command line settings.

Basic config file example is in examples/switchres.conf

==========================
Simple Modeline generation:
==========================

switchres --calc pacman
switchres 384 288 60.61 --monitor d9800


=====================
Running games in MAME:
=====================

switchres pacman --monitor cga
switchres frogger --ff --redraw --nodoublescan --monitor d9200

# ArcadeVGA files in Windows
switchres tron --resfile extra/ArcadeVGA.txt --resfile ~/modes.txt

# Soft15Khz in Windows reading registry modelines
switchres tron --soft15khz

=================================
Running games for other emulators:
=================================

switchres a2600 --emulator mess --rom /path/to/ROM\ File.bin --args -verbose -sdlvideofps

Anything after --args is passed to the emulator, in this case 'mess'.

The game rom becomes the game system, even for other emulators, mess is still used to get the games
correct resolution.
