================================
Update 2016-05-09 - Version 1.53
================================

- Fixed compilation warnings.
- Fixed bad memory allocation.
- Removed all "goto"s statements.


================================
Update 2014-05-10 - Version 1.52
================================

- Added new option --edid. This option creates an EDID binary file (edid.bin)
  based on the calculated modeline and the monitor ranges used in its
  calculation. This file can be passed to the Linux kernel on boot in order to
  enable the same user defined timings for KMS and Xorg.


================================
Update 2014-05-07 - Version 1.51
================================

- Fixed segmentation fault when using some presets (lcd, k7000).
- New monitor presets:
  * pc_31_120: a preset for 120Hz capable PC CRT monitors, at 31kHz (VGA).
  * pc_70_120: same as pc_31_120, but for monitors capable of up to 70kH (SXGA).
  * r666b: Rodotron 666B-29

Note: both 32 and 64 bit binaries are provided as 'switchres32' and 'switchres64'
Remind renaming the one you need as 'switchres' if you use it with Groovy Arcade.

===============================
Update 2012-12-14 - Version 1.5
===============================

SwitchRes has been updated to make it compatible with the new crt_specs format, and to add
all the monitor presets that GroovyMAME's currently supports. This includes VESA GTF.

However this is a patch, as internally the specs are converted to the old format.
Eventually all the modeline generation engine should be updated to the new GroovyMAME's methods.
